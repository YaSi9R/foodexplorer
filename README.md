## üß† Methodology

The application is designed as a single-page React app with the following architecture:

- **State Management**: `useState` and `useEffect` are used to manage search state, category filters, and paginated product lists.
- **Search & Filter**:
  - Unified search bar supports both name and barcode lookup.
  - API endpoints are called conditionally based on user input.
- **Performance**:
  - Only fetches more products when "Load More" is clicked.
  - Handles API fallback if the OpenFoodFacts server is slow or unresponsive.
- **User Experience**:
  - Placeholder images, loading states, and graceful error messages enhance usability.
